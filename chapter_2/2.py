# 2. Unary minus negates a number. Unary plus exists as well; for example,
# Python understands +5. If x has the value -17, what do you think +x
# should do? Should it leave the sign of the number alone? Should it act
# like absolute value, removing any negation? Use the Python shell to find
# out its behavior.

print('+42:', str(+42))
print('+(-42):', str(+(-42)))
