# Why does the last example in Section 5.4, Remembering the Results of a
# Boolean Expression Evaluation, on page 97, check to see whether someone
# is heavy (that is, that personâ€™s weight exceeds the threshold) rather than
# light? If you wanted to write the second assignment statement as light =
# bmi < 22.0, what change(s) would you have to make to the lookup table?

# I suspect this is an error here as nowhere is 'heavy' or 'light' used in
# the text.
