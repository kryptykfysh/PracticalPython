# Consider the following statement, which creates a list of populations of
# countries in eastern Asia (China, DPR Korea, Hong Kong, Mongolia,
# Republic of Korea, and Taiwan) in millions: country_populations = [1295, 23, 7,
# 3, 47, 21]. Write a for loop that adds up all the values and stores them in
# the total variable. (Hint: Give total an initial value of zero, and, inside the
# loop body, add the population of the current country to total.)
country_populations = [1295, 23, 7, 3, 47, 21]
total = 0

for population in country_populations:
